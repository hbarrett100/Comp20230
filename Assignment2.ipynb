    "### 1) Singly Linked List\n",
    "In the cells below I implement a singly linked list. Briefly, a singly linked list is a collection of nodes. Each node contains a reference to an element and a reference to the next node of the list. The first node of a singly linked list is known as the head and the last node is known as the tail. We can move from the head to the tail of the list by following the reference to each nodes next node. Linked lists have two interesting features - they do not have a predetermined size and they use space proportionally to the current number of elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement the singly linked list I create two classes. The first class is the ```Node``` class. Each node stores an element in the list. Each node also contains a reference to the next element in the linked list. "

    "In the cell below the second class ```myLinkedList``` is created. The constructor within this class initialises the head and tail to ```None``` and the size of the list to 0. Thus, an empty linked list is created initially. \n",
    "\n",
    "This class contains five methods. The first method ```add_first``` adds a new node to the start of the linked list. An instance of the ```Node``` class is created and the variable ```head``` is set equal to this new node. The size of the list in increased by 1. The conditional statement within this method accounts for when this method is initially called on an empty list. As this new node is the first node in the list, the variable ```tail``` is also assigned to this node at this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method ```add_last``` adds an element to the tail of the linked list. A new instance of the ```Node``` class is created, thus creating a new node in the list. The node next to the variable ```tail``` is assigned to the new node. The variable ```tail``` is then assigned to this new node. The size of the list is increaed by 1. Again, the conditional statement here accounts for when this method is initally called on an empty list. In the case, this new node is also the head of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method ```remove_first``` removes the head of the linked list. The variable ```head``` is moved to the next element in the list and the size of the list decreases by 1. An error is printed if this method is called on an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method ```list_traversal``` traverses the list from the head to the tail and prints out each element. Each element is printing by moving the pointer from the current element to the next element in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I have added two extra methods. The first is called ```is_empty()``` which returns true if the linked list is empty and false otherwise. The second method ```len()``` returns the size of the linked list. This is implemented so that users can access the size of the linked list in the same way as a regular python list. "

    "### 2) Stack ADT & Queue ADT\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define in your own words the terms stack ADT and queue ADT**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A stack ADT is a collection of elements that are added and removed from one end only, known as the \"top\". In other words, the stack follows the last-in, first-out principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A queue ADT is a collection of elements which follow the first-in, first-out principle. Elements are added to one end of the queue and removed from the other end. Only the element that has been in the queue the longest is removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**List the key operations and support operations commonly associated with the ADTs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack ADT: \n",
    "- The key operations are push( ) and pop( ).\n",
    "- The support operations are top( ), is_empty( ) and len( ).\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue ADT:\n",
    "- The key operations are enqueue( ) and dequeue( ).\n",
    "- The support operations are first( ), is_empty( ) and len( ).\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each ADT give two real world examples and explain them briefly**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack ADT:\n",
    "- Example 1: The stack ADT is used in the validation of markup languages such as HTML. A HTML document contains 'HTML tags' throughout in order to delimit portions of text such a headers and paragraphs. The beginning tag is surrounded by \"<\" and \">\" and the ending tag begins with \"</\" and ends with \">\". A HTML document should have matching tags and this is where the stack ADT is used. The document is searched and all opening tags \"<\" are pushed on to the stack. They are then matched with closing tags as they are popped from the stack. (REF BOOK)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example 2: As described at https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ce46/fd8d181c71eb192c5a8f75f716281669226c.pdf, the stack ADT is used to navigate back/forward to different web pages on a web browser. Essentially, a stack of visited pages is created. Clicking on or typing a link adds a webpage to the top of the stack. When the back button is pressed, the stack pointer moves down the stack pile and disaplys the webpage at that stack location. Similarly, when the forward button is pressed, the stack pointer moves up the stack pile. If a user is on a webpage inside the stack and they type or click on a new link, all webpages above the current position are popped off the stack and the new one is pushed on top. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue ADT:\n",
    "- Example 1: As described at http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/Week5.html, one use for the queue ADT is a networked printer. The operating system forms a queue of processes which are waiting to use the printer. Once a process is using the printer, it can continue until finished. The unique id of all other waiting processes are kept in the queue. Once the current process is finished using the printer, the process id that has been in the queue the longest can now use the printer.\n",
    "- Example 2: A customer call centre uses a queue ADT to manage incoming calls. Each time a customer service employee becomes available, they are connected to the call that was removed from the front of the queue and all customers who call in are added to the end of the waiting queue.
