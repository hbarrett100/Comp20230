    "### Part 1 Q2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Define in your own words the terms stack ADT and queue ADT**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A stack ADT is a collection of elements that are added and removed from one end only, known as the \"top\". In other words, the stack follows the last-in, first-out principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A queue ADT is a collection of elements which follow the first-in, first-out principle. Elements are added to one end of the queue and removed from the other end. Only the element that has been in the queue the longest is removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**List the key operations and support operations commonly associated with the ADTs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack ADT: \n",
    "- The key operations are push() and pop().\n",
    "- The support operations are top(), is_empty() and len().\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue ADT:\n",
    "- The key operations are enqueue() and dequeue().\n",
    "- The support operations are first(), is_empty() and len().\n",
    "\n",
    "**For each ADT give two real world examples and explain them briefly**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack ADT:\n",
    "- Example 1: The stack ADT is used in the validation of markup languages such as HTML. A HTML document contains 'HTML tags' throughout in order to delimit portions of text such a headers and paragraphs. The beginning tag is surrounded by \"<\" and \">\" and the ending tag begins with \"</\" and ends with \">\". A HTML document should have matching tags and this is where the stack ADT is used. The document is searhced and all opening tags \"<\" are pushed on to the stack. They are then matched with closing tags as they are popped from the stack. (REF BOOK)\n",
    "- Example 2: As described at https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ce46/fd8d181c71eb192c5a8f75f716281669226c.pdf, the stack ADT is used to navigate back/forward to different web pages on a web browser. Essentially, a stack of visited pages is created. Clicking on or typing a link adds a webpage to the top of the stack. When the back button is pressed, the stack pointer moves down the stack pile and disaplys the webpage at that stack location. Similarly, when the forward button is pressed, the stack pointer moves up the stack pile. If a user is on a webpage inside the stack and they type or click on a new link, all webpages above the current position are popped off the stack and the new one is pushed on top. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Queue ADT:\n",
    "- Example 1: As described at http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/Week5.html, one use for the queue ADT is the a networked printer. The operating system forms a queue of processes which are waiting to use the printer. Once a process is using the printer, it can continue until finished. The unique id of all other waiting processes are kept in the queue. Once the current process is finished using the printer, the process id that has been in the queue the longest can now use the printer.\n",
    "- Example 2: The operating system manages the CPU with a queue of processes. "
